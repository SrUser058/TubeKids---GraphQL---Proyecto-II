### How install?

You need Node.js or any runtime environment of Javascript in your computer, in this case I use npm, but you can use pnpm or any package installer.


```
    npm install express

    npm install cors

    npm install dotenv

    npm install mongoose

    npm install graphql graphql-express

    npm install crypto

    npm install jsonwebtoken
```
I recommend you install graphql@14.6.0, express-graphql@0.9.0 and express@4.19.2. This because newest version throw errors between its.

And as last recommend, install nodemon in case you test your changes while executing this API.

```
    npm instal nodemon
```

Also yo can download the Client Side created and updated by me in the next repository: [https://github.com/SrUser058/TubeKids---Frontend---Proyecto-II](https://github.com/SrUser058/TubeKids---Frontend---Proyecto-II)

If you don't install nodemon, you  wll need to create in the package.json file the command to execute the API in your environment.
